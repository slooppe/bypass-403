# Bypass 403

Try to bypass HTTP 403 by sending headers that try to make the tested server think that
the request comes from localhost thus allowing you to view the page.

## Usage Example

Here, a file called `urls.txt` contains a list of urls that you want to check.

```
▶ cat urls.txt
https://google.com
https://twitter.com

▶ cat urls.txt | ./bypass_403 -timeout 10 -threads 10
```

## Install

```
▶ go get -u github.com/amourha/bypass-403
